		<p class="info">Hi! I'm a software engineer currently working at <a href="https://www.leidos.com/">Leidos</a>. I graduated from Virginia Tech in 2019. Though I consider Virginia to be my home state, I've moved around the U.S. quite a few times. My hobbies include watching and moderating streams on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/">Twitch.tv</a>, writing poetry, and playing the video game Super Smash Bros. competitively. During my time at Virginia Tech, I was an active member in the Super Smash Bros. Club, and I also participated in several hackathons. I love learning new things, especially in the ever-growing world of computer science. Please feel free to <a href="#">contact me</a>!</p>
